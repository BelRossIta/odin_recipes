                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Make the filling: Place pork, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to love and simmer until pork is cook through, about 2 hours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, make the chile sauce: Use rubber gloves to remove stems and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan with 2 cup of water. Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Transfer chiles and cooking water to a blender and blend until smooth. Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <p>
                    Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup of chile sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce for serving.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                <p>
                    Prepare husks and dough: Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water until softened, about 30 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>
                    While the husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablespoon of broth until fluffy. Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl: stir into the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a spongy dough.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 7</h3>
                <p>
                    Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over husk to 1/4-to-1/2-inch thick.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 8</h3>
                <p>
                    Place 1 tablespoon pork filling over center of each one. Fold the sides, top, and bottom of each husk in toward the center to enclose dough.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 9</h3>
                <p>
                    Arrange tamales in a steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 1 hour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step 10</h3>
                <p>
                    Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauce and top with sour cream, or mix sour cream into chile sauce first for a creamy sauce.
