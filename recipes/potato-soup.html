                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Gather all ingredients.

                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease

            <li>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>
                    Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon dripping until the onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.

                <p>
                    Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chick stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

                    Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.

                <p>
                    Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.
